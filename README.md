# Optimization

The project.py implement PSO-KNN algorithm to finish the experiment on the training dataset. It will to take around one to two hours to get the plot in my project because my chosen algorithm and the cross validation strategy. project_test.py carries the experiment on the test dataset using the best chosen model . The counts printed when running my code means it is in the single cross validation. I use the sklearn library to do PCA ,KNN and cross validation.

And in another four directories, there are four assignments and involve some basic tasks to solve relevant optimization problem, such like picture reconstruction etc.
